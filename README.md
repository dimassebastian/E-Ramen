"E-ramen" is my debut project in HTML/CSS/JS, a simple online ramen website. It's a basic exploration into web development, where I'm learning to structure web pages, style them with CSS, and add some interactivity with JavaScript. With E-ramen, I'm venturing into the world of front-end development, aiming to create a visually appealing and user-friendly platform for ramen enthusiasts to explore different flavors and recipes.
